#Following is the code to adjust the size of the text dynamically in flutter
AppBar(
    centerTitle: true,
    title: FittedBox(
        fit: BoxFit.fitWidth, 
        child: Text('Hey this is my long text appbar title')
    ),
),

We can wrap the text around the FittedBox widget and then define the property fit to Box.fixWidht
